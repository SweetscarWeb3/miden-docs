# Quick Start

Welcome to Miden! This guide will get you up and running with the Miden blockchain by walking you through the essential setup and core operations.

## What is Miden?

Miden is a privacy-focused, ZK-based blockchain that uses an actor model where each account is a smart contract. Unlike traditional blockchains where accounts simply hold balances, Miden accounts are programmable entities that can execute custom logic, store data, and manage assets autonomously.

Key concepts you'll encounter:

- **Accounts**: Smart contracts that hold assets and execute code
- **Notes**: Messages that exchange data and assets between accounts - also programmable
- **Assets**: Tokens that can be fungible or non-fungible
- **Privacy**: Every transaction, note and account in Miden is private by default — only the involved parties can view asset amounts or transfer details, offering strong confidentiality guarantees.

## Getting Started
